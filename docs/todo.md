# PrimeStruct TODO Log

## Operating Rules (Human + AI)

1. This file contains only open work (`[ ]` or `[~]`).
2. Use one task block per item with a stable ID: `TODO-XXXX`.
3. Keep newest items at the top of `## Open Tasks`.
4. Every task must include:
   - clear scope
   - acceptance criteria
   - owner (`human` or `ai`)
5. When a task is completed:
   - mark it `[x]`
   - add `finished_at` and short evidence note
   - move the full block to `docs/todo_finished.md`
   - remove it from this file (do not keep completed tasks here)
6. `docs/todo_finished.md` is append-only history. Do not rewrite old entries except to fix factual mistakes.
7. Each implementation task SHOULD include `phase` and `depends_on` to keep execution order explicit.
8. Prefer small, testable tasks over broad epics; split before starting if acceptance cannot be verified in one PR.
9. Keep the `Execution Queue` and coverage snapshots current when adding/removing tasks.
10. Keep an explicit `Ready Now` shortlist synced with dependencies; only items with no unmet TODO dependencies belong there.
11. When splitting broad tasks, update parent task scope to avoid duplicated acceptance criteria across child tasks.
12. Keep `Priority Lanes` aligned with queue order so critical-path tasks remain visible.
13. For phase-level tracking tasks, pair planning trackers with explicit acceptance-gate tasks before marking a phase complete.
14. Every active leaf must include a stop rule and deliver at least one of:
   - user-visible behavior change
   - measurable perf/memory improvement
   - deletion of a real compatibility subsystem
15. Avoid standalone micro-cleanups (alias renames, trivial bool rewrites, local dedup) unless bundled into one value outcome above.
16. If a leaf misses its value target after 2 attempts, archive it as low-value and replace it with a different hotspot.
17. Keep the live execution queue short: no more than 8 leaf tasks in `Ready Now` at once. Additional dependency-blocked or deferred follow-up leaves may stay in the task blocks and `Immediate Next 10`, but only `Ready Now` counts as the live queue cap.
18. Treat disabled tests as debt: every retained `doctest::skip(true)` cluster must either map to an active TODO leaf with a clear re-enable-or-delete outcome, or be removed once proven stale.

### Vector/Map Bridge Contract Summary

- Bridge-owned public contract: exact and wildcard `/std/collections` imports,
  `vector<T>` / `map<K, V>` constructor and literal-rewrite surfaces, helper
  families, compatibility spellings plus removed-helper diagnostics, semantic
  surface IDs, and lowerer dispatch metadata.
- Migration-only seams: rooted `/vector/*` and `/map/*` spellings,
  `vectorCount` / `mapCount`-style lowering names, and
  `/std/collections/experimental_*` implementation modules stay temporary until
  the later cutover TODOs retire them.
- Outside this lane: `array<T>` core ownership, `soa_vector<T>` maturity, and
  runtime/storage redesign remain separate boundaries and should not be folded
  into the vector/map bridge tasks below.

### Stdlib De-Experimentalization Policy Summary

- Canonical public API: non-`experimental` namespaces are the intended
  long-term user-facing contracts.
- Canonical collection contract: `/std/collections/vector/*` and
  `/std/collections/map/*` are the sole public vector/map collection surfaces.
- Temporary compatibility namespaces:
  `/std/collections/experimental_soa_vector/*`, and
  `/std/collections/experimental_soa_vector_conversions/*` stay transitional
  until their explicit shim, rename, or maturity TODOs land.
- Internal collection implementation modules:
  `/std/collections/experimental_vector/*` and
  `/std/collections/experimental_map/*` now remain implementation-owned seams
  behind canonical `/std/collections/vector/*` and `/std/collections/map/*`,
  with direct imports kept only for targeted compatibility or conformance
  coverage.
- Legacy gfx compatibility seam: `/std/gfx/experimental/*` remains importable
  only for targeted compatibility coverage and staged migration support;
  canonical `/std/gfx/*` is the only public gfx namespace.
- Internal substrate/helper namespaces:
  `/std/collections/internal_buffer_checked/*`,
  `/std/collections/internal_buffer_unchecked/*`, and
  `/std/collections/internal_soa_storage/*` are implementation-facing
  plumbing rather than public API.
- Default rule: no `experimental` namespace is canonical public API unless the
  docs call out a temporary incubating exception explicitly.

### SoA Maturity Track Summary

- `soa_vector<T>` remains an incubating public extension instead of joining the
  already-promoted vector/map public contract.
- Canonical experiment spellings for current docs/examples are
  `/std/collections/soa_vector/*` and
  `/std/collections/soa_vector_conversions/*`.
- Compatibility-only namespaces:
  `/std/collections/experimental_soa_vector/*` and
  `/std/collections/experimental_soa_vector_conversions/*` remain bridge seams
  behind the canonical experiment surface.
- Internal substrate namespace:
  `/std/collections/internal_soa_storage/*` remains implementation-facing
  SoA storage/layout plumbing.
- Promotion requires borrowed-view/lifetime rules, backend/runtime parity, and
  retirement of direct experimental implementation imports before `soa_vector`
  can be treated as a promoted public contract.

### Skipped Doctest Debt Summary

- Retained `doctest::skip(true)` coverage is currently absent from the active
  queue because no skipped doctest cases remain under `tests/unit`.
- New skipped doctest coverage must create a new explicit TODO before it lands.
- The success condition for each lane is re-enable-or-delete; indefinite
  skipped coverage is not a stable end state.

### Task Blocks

- [ ] TODO-4146: Split or optimize slow serialization shards
  - owner: ai
  - created_at: 2026-04-25
  - phase: Test-suite audit follow-up and release-gate stability
  - scope: Investigate the `primestruct.ir_pipeline.serialization` release
    shards that currently exceed the doctest runtime guardrail in
    `build-release/Testing/Temporary/CTestCostData.txt`, especially cases
    `53_56`, `57_60`, and `61_64`, and reduce the hotspot through smaller
    shards or targeted test/runtime optimization without dropping coverage.
  - acceptance:
    - No serialization shard with multiple cases remains above 5 seconds in
      routine release validation unless the test source or registration gains
      a brief justification for the retained cost.
    - The touched serialization shards keep deterministic ordering and preserve
      the current serialization contract coverage.
    - Focused release reruns for the touched serialization shards pass from
      `build-release/`.
  - stop_rule: Limit work to serialization tests, shard registration, and the
    smallest helper/runtime changes needed to reduce the hotspot; do not
    broaden into unrelated backend refactors.

- [ ] TODO-4145: Reconcile stale wrapper-helper audit expectations
  - owner: ai
  - created_at: 2026-04-25
  - phase: Test-suite audit follow-up and release-gate stability
  - scope: Audit the pre-existing release failures in
    `tests/unit/test_semantics_calls_and_flow_collections_wrapper_temporary_templated_vector_methods.cpp`
    and `tests/unit/test_compile_run_emitters_map_count_and_wrapper_capacity.cpp`,
    then rewrite or split the stale vector/map helper expectations so the
    files assert the current external contract instead of outdated diagnostics.
  - acceptance:
    - Focused release reruns for both touched source files pass from
      `build-release/`, or any remaining blocker is narrowed into a smaller
      explicit follow-up TODO with the stale expectations removed.
    - Duplicate or stale assertions around namespaced vector/map helper routing
      are removed, renamed, or rewritten to match the currently observed
      semantics and C++ emitter behavior.
    - Any queue/docs-lock coverage affected by the audit stays synchronized
      with `docs/todo.md`.
  - stop_rule: Keep the slice limited to those two audit families plus minimal
    shared helper or docs-lock adjustments needed to make the release-facing
    contract explicit.
