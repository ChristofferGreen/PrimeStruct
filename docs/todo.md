# PrimeStruct TODO Log

## Operating Rules (Human + AI)

1. This file contains only open work (`[ ]` or `[~]`).
2. Use one task block per item with a stable ID: `TODO-XXXX`.
3. Keep newest items at the top of `## Open Tasks`.
4. Every task must include:
   - clear scope
   - acceptance criteria
   - owner (`human` or `ai`)
5. When a task is completed:
   - mark it `[x]`
   - add `finished_at` and short evidence note
   - move the full block to `docs/todo_finished.md`
   - remove it from this file (do not keep completed tasks here)
6. `docs/todo_finished.md` is append-only history. Do not rewrite old entries except to fix factual mistakes.
7. Each implementation task SHOULD include `phase` and `depends_on` to keep execution order explicit.
8. Prefer small, testable tasks over broad epics; split before starting if acceptance cannot be verified in one PR.
9. Keep the `Execution Queue` and coverage snapshots current when adding/removing tasks.
10. Keep an explicit `Ready Now` shortlist synced with dependencies; only items with no unmet TODO dependencies belong there.
11. When splitting broad tasks, update parent task scope to avoid duplicated acceptance criteria across child tasks.
12. Keep `Priority Lanes` aligned with queue order so critical-path tasks remain visible.
13. For phase-level tracking tasks, pair planning trackers with explicit acceptance-gate tasks before marking a phase complete.
14. Every active leaf must include a stop rule and deliver at least one of:
   - user-visible behavior change
   - measurable perf/memory improvement
   - deletion of a real compatibility subsystem
15. Avoid standalone micro-cleanups (alias renames, trivial bool rewrites, local dedup) unless bundled into one value outcome above.
16. If a leaf misses its value target after 2 attempts, archive it as low-value and replace it with a different hotspot.
17. Keep the active queue short: no more than 8 live leaves at once.

Status legend:
- `[ ]` queued

### Task Blocks

- [ ] TODO-1012: Index try facts by operand path and source in the shared semantic-product adapter index
  - owner: ai
  - created_at: 2026-04-19
  - phase: Group 15
  - scope: Extend the shared `SemanticProductIndex` builder so try fact lookup resolves operand-path-plus-source matches without rebuilding or scanning the try fact view in lowerer adapter helpers.
  - acceptance:
    - `SemanticProductIndexBuilder` populates `tryFactsByOperandPathAndSource` from `semanticProgramTryFactView(...)` while preserving the existing semantic-node lookup.
    - `findSemanticProductTryFact(...)` resolves operand-path-plus-source matches through the shared semantic index without a fallback scan over try facts (baseline: one adapter-side try fallback scan remains today; target: zero).
    - Focused lowerer adapter runtime and source-lock coverage pins the new composite-key indexing and the deleted fallback scan.
  - stop_rule: If try composite-key indexing also requires changing semantic-product emission/layout contracts, split that storage change into a separate leaf before continuing.
  - notes: Follow-on to archived children `TODO-1008`, `TODO-1009`, `TODO-1010`, and `TODO-1011`, which moved return-fact, on-error, local-auto, and query fallback lookup into the shared semantic-product adapter index.

- [ ] TODO-0406: Split production semantics APIs from testing snapshots
  - owner: ai
  - created_at: 2026-04-13
  - phase: Group 15
  - depends_on: TODO-0405
  - scope: Move snapshot-for-testing surface area out of production semantics interfaces and into explicit `include/primec/testing/*` facades so runtime/compiler consumers only depend on production contracts.
  - acceptance:
    - Production-facing semantics headers stop exposing snapshot-only structs/methods used exclusively by tests.
    - Existing semantics/IR snapshot tests compile and pass through testing facades without adding new `tests -> src` include-layer allowlist entries.
    - At least one snapshot-only compatibility path in production semantics code is deleted rather than relocated.
  - stop_rule: If removal breaks unrelated runtime/backend callsites, split into two leaves (facade introduction first, production API pruning second) before continuing.

- [~] TODO-0405: Introduce unified semantic-product index builder
  - owner: ai
  - created_at: 2026-04-13
  - phase: Group 15
  - depends_on: TODO-0404
  - scope: Replace ad-hoc lowerer semantic-product lookup-map construction with one typed `SemanticProductIndex` builder and shared lookup API for direct/method/bridge/binding/local-auto/query/try/on_error families.
  - file_todos:
    - [x] `TODO-0405-F01` files: `/Users/chrgre01/src/PrimeStruct/src/ir_lowerer/IrLowererSemanticProductTargetAdapters.{h,cpp}`, `/Users/chrgre01/src/PrimeStruct/include/primec/testing/ir_lowerer_helpers/IrLowererSemanticProductTargetAdapters.h`; fix: introduce a typed `SemanticProductIndex` plus `SemanticProductIndexBuilder`, wire adapter construction through that builder for direct/method/bridge/binding/local-auto/query/try/on_error family indices, and route semantic lookup helpers through shared index-backed lookup paths.
    - [x] `TODO-0405-F02` files: `/Users/chrgre01/src/PrimeStruct/src/ir_lowerer/IrLowererSemanticProductTargetAdapters.cpp`, `/Users/chrgre01/src/PrimeStruct/tests/unit/test_ir_pipeline_validation_ir_lowerer_call_helpers_source_delegation_stays_stable.cpp`, `/Users/chrgre01/src/PrimeStruct/tests/unit/test_ir_pipeline_backends_graph_contexts.h`; fix: remove transitional duplicated legacy adapter-map population/fallback paths and migrate downstream checks to consume `SemanticProductIndex` directly.
    - [x] `TODO-0405-F03` files: `/Users/chrgre01/src/PrimeStruct/tests/unit/test_ir_pipeline_backends_registry.cpp`, `/Users/chrgre01/src/PrimeStruct/tests/unit/test_semantics_definition_partitioner.cpp`; fix: add/refresh deterministic parity coverage across worker counts (`1`, `2`, `4`) for the unified index path.
  - acceptance:
    - Lowerer semantic-product adapter paths consume one shared index builder instead of duplicating per-family map assembly logic.
    - Determinism parity coverage keeps semantic-product output and diagnostics stable across worker counts (`1`, `2`, `4`) on existing stress fixtures.
    - Semantic memory benchmark reports show non-regression for the semantic-product/lowering path, with measurable allocation or runtime improvement in at least one tracked fixture.
  - stop_rule: If measurable benchmark impact is not achieved after two attempts, archive this leaf as low-value per rule 16 and replace it with a different Group 15 hotspot.
  - notes: Archived children `TODO-1008`, `TODO-1009`, `TODO-1010`, and `TODO-1011` moved return-fact, on-error, local-auto, and query fallback lookup into the shared semantic-product adapter index. Active child `TODO-1012` now targets the remaining try operand-path fallback scan.

- [ ] TODO-0403: Keep queue, lanes, and snapshots synchronized
  - owner: ai
  - created_at: 2026-04-13
  - phase: Cross-cutting
  - depends_on: TODO-0402
  - scope: Keep this TODO log internally consistent as Group 14/15 leaf tasks are added, split, completed, and archived.
  - acceptance:
    - Every TODO ID listed in `Ready Now`, `Immediate Next 10`, `Priority Lanes`, and `Execution Queue` has a matching task block.
    - Archived IDs are removed from open sections in the same change that moves their task blocks to `docs/todo_finished.md`.
    - Coverage snapshot tables reflect only currently open IDs.
  - stop_rule: If synchronization touches more than one logical workstream, split updates into focused queue-only follow-up tasks.

- [~] TODO-0402: Group 15 completion tracker (semantic memory + multithread substrate)
  - owner: ai
  - created_at: 2026-04-13
  - phase: Group 15
  - scope: Define and execute remaining measurable leaf slices after archived P0/P1/P2 work to ship memory/runtime wins with strict regression control.
  - acceptance:
    - Remaining Group 15 leaf tasks are listed with stable IDs and explicit metric baselines/targets.
    - Each new leaf includes concrete validation commands, including release build/test and focused benchmark or memory checks.
    - Completed Group 15 leaves are moved to `docs/todo_finished.md` with evidence notes.
  - stop_rule: If a leaf cannot demonstrate measurable impact within one code-affecting commit, split it into smaller measurable leaves before implementation.
  - notes: Prior Group 15 slices `[P0-17]` through `[P0-28]`, `[P1-01]` through `[P1-03]`, and `[P2-14]` through `[P2-42]` are already archived in `docs/todo_finished.md` (April 12-13, 2026). Archived children `TODO-1008`, `TODO-1009`, `TODO-1010`, and `TODO-1011` moved return-fact, on-error, local-auto, and query fallback lookup into the shared semantic-product adapter index.
