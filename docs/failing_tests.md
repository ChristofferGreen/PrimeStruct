# Failing Tests

This file is the live registry for test cases that failed on the most recent
`scripts/compile.sh` test run. Focused release test invocations should still be
recorded here manually before starting new implementation work.

## Workflow

1. Run the release validation path first.
2. Let `scripts/compile.sh` refresh the managed failure list after full script
   runs.
3. Fix the smallest reproducible failure first.
4. Rerun the smallest relevant release-mode test binary or doctest case.
5. Keep `docs/todo.md` pointed at test-fix work before new feature work.

## Current Failures

<!-- compile.sh:failing-tests:start -->
- Last updated: `2026-06-04T13:20:32Z`
- Build type: `Debug`
- Build dir: `build-debug`
- Command: `ctest --test-dir build-debug --output-on-failure --parallel 11`
- Result: `ctest` failed with status `137`.
- Failing CTest cases:
<!-- compile.sh:failing-tests:end -->

## Notes

- The block under `## Current Failures` is managed by `scripts/compile.sh`
  when tests are run. Keep manual notes outside the managed markers.
- Add new failures here as soon as a release run exposes them.
- Remove entries only after the corresponding release-mode fix is verified.
