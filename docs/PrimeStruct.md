# PrimeStruct Plan

PrimeStruct is built around a simple philosophy: program meaning emerges from two primitives—**definitions** (potential) and **executions** (actual). Rather than bolting on dozens of bespoke constructs, we give both forms the same syntactic envelope and let compile-time transforms massage the surface into a canonical core. From that small nucleus we can target C++, GLSL, or the PrimeStruct VM, wire into PathSpace, and even feed future visual editors, all without sacrificing deterministic semantics.

### Source-processing pipeline
1. **Include resolver:** first pass walks the raw text and expands every `include<...>` inline (C-style) so the compiler always works on a single flattened source stream.
2. **Textual metafunction filters:** the flattened stream flows through ordered token/text filters that execute `[transform ...]` rules declared to operate pre-AST (operator sugar, project-specific macros, etc.).
3. **AST builder:** once textual transforms finish, the parser builds the canonical AST.
4. **Template & semantic resolver:** monomorphise templates, resolve namespaces, and apply semantic transforms (borrow checks, effects) so the tree is fully typed.
5. **IR lowering:** emit the shared SSA-style IR only after templates/semantics are resolved, ensuring every backend consumes an identical canonical form.

Each filter stage halts on error (reporting diagnostics immediately) and exposes a `--dump-stage=<name>` switch so tooling/tests can capture the textual/tree output produced just before the failure.

## Phase 0 — Scope & Acceptance Gates (must precede implementation)
- **Charter:** capture exactly which language primitives, transforms, and effect rules belong in PrimeStruct v0, and list anything explicitly deferred to later phases.
- **Success criteria:** define measurable gates (parser coverage, IR validation, backend round-trips, sample programs) so reviewers can tell when v0 is complete.
- **Ownership map:** assign leads for parser, IR/type system, first backend, and test infrastructure, plus security/runtime reviewers.
- **Integration plan:** describe how the compiler/test suite slots into the build (targets, CI loops, feature flags, artifact publishing).
- **Risk log:** record open questions (borrow checker, capability taxonomy, GPU backend constraints) and mitigation/rollback strategies.
- **Exit:** only after this phase is reviewed/approved do parser/IR/backend implementations begin; the conformance suite derives from the frozen charter instead of chasing a moving target.

## Phase 1 — Minimal Compiler That Emits an Executable
Goal: a tiny end-to-end compiler path that turns a single PrimeStruct source file into a runnable native executable. This is the smallest vertical slice that proves parsing, IR, a backend, and a host toolchain handoff.

### Acceptance criteria
- A single-file PrimeStruct program with one entry definition compiles to a native executable on macOS (initial target).
- The compiler can:
  - Parse a subset of the uniform envelope (definitions + executions).
  - Build a canonical AST for that subset.
  - Lower to a minimal IR (calls, literals, return).
  - Emit C++ and invoke a host compiler to produce an executable.
- The produced executable runs and returns a deterministic exit code.

### Minimal surface for v0.1
- `return(...)` primitive only.
- Integer literal support (signed 32-bit, requires `i32` suffix).
- `[return<int>]` transform on the entry definition.
- A single `main()`-like entry definition (`main()`).

### Example source and expected IR (sketch)
PrimeStruct:
```
[return<int>]
main() {
  return(42i32)
}
```

Expected IR (shape only):
```
module {
  def main(): i32 {
    return 42
  }
}
```

### Compiler driver behavior (plan)
- `PrimeStructc --emit=cpp input.prime -o build/hello.cpp`
- `PrimeStructc --emit=exe input.prime -o build/hello`
  - Uses the C++ emitter plus the host toolchain (initially `clang++`).
  - Bundles a minimal runtime shim that maps `main` to `int main()`.
- All generated outputs land under `build/` (configurable by `--out-dir`).

## Goals
- Single authoring language spanning gameplay/domain scripting, UI logic, automation, and rendering shaders.
- Emit high-performance C++ for engine integration, GLSL/SPIR-V for GPU shading, and bytecode for an embedded VM without diverging semantics.
- Share a consistent standard library (math, texture IO, resource bindings, PathSpace helpers) across backends while preserving determinism for replay/testing.

## Proposed Architecture
- **Front-end parser:** C/TypeScript-inspired surface syntax with explicit types, deterministic control flow, and borrow-checked resource usage.
- **Transform pipeline:** ordered `[transform]` functions rewrite the forthcoming AST (or raw tokens) before semantic analysis. The default chain desugars infix operators, control-flow, assignment, etc.; projects can override via `--transform-list` flags.
- **Transform pipeline:** ordered `[transform]` functions rewrite the forthcoming AST (or raw tokens) before semantic analysis. The compiler can auto-inject transforms per definition/execution (e.g., attach `operator_infix_default` to every function) with optional path filters (`/math/*`, recurse or not) so common rewrites don’t have to be annotated manually. The default chain desugars infix operators, control-flow, assignment, etc.; projects can override via `--transform-list` flags.
- **Intermediate representation:** strongly-typed SSA-style IR shared by every backend (C++, GLSL, VM, future LLVM). Normalisation happens once; backends never see syntactic sugar.
- **Backends:**
  - **C++ emitter** – generates host code or LLVM IR for native binaries/JITs.
  - **GLSL/SPIR-V emitter** – produces shader code; a Metal translation remains future work.
  - **VM bytecode** – compact instruction set executed by the embedded interpreter/JIT.
- **Tooling:** CLI compiler `PrimeStructc` plus build/test helpers. The compiler accepts `--entry /path` to select the entry definition (default: `/main`). The definition/execution split maps cleanly to future node-based editors; full IDE/LSP integration is deferred until the compiler stabilises.

## Language Design Highlights
- **Identifiers:** `[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*` plus the slash-prefixed form `/segment/segment/...` for fully-qualified paths. Unicode may arrive later, but v0 constrains identifiers to ASCII for predictable tooling and hashing. `mut`, `return`, `include`, `namespace`, `true`, and `false` are reserved keywords; any other identifier (including slash paths) can serve as a transform, path segment, parameter, or binding.
- **Uniform envelope:** every construct uses `[transform-list] identifier<template-list>(parameter-list) {body-list}`. Lists recursively reuse whitespace-separated tokens.
  - `[...]` enumerates metafunction transforms applied in order (see “Built-in transforms”).
  - `<...>` supplies compile-time types/templates—primarily for transforms or when inference must be overridden.
  - `(...)` lists runtime parameters and captures.
  - `{...}` holds either a definition body or, in the execution case, an argument list for higher-order constructs.
- **Definitions vs executions:** definitions include a body (`{…}`) and optional transforms; executions are call-style (`execute_task<…>(args)`) with no body. The compiler decides whether to emit callable artifacts or schedule work based on that presence.
- **Return annotation:** definitions declare return types via transforms (e.g., `[return<float>] blend<…>(…) { … }`). Executions return values explicitly (`return(value)`); the desugared form is always canonical.
- **Effects:** functions are pure by default. Authors opt into side effects with attributes such as `[effects(global_write, io_stdout)]`. Standard library routines permit stdout/stderr logging; backends reject unsupported effects (e.g., GPU code requesting filesystem access).
- **Paths & includes:** every definition/execution lives at a canonical path (`/ui/widgets/log_button_press`). Authors can spell the path inline or rely on `namespace foo { ... }` blocks to prepend `/foo` automatically; includes simply splice text, so they inherit whatever path context is active. `include<"/std/io", version="1.2.0">` searches the include path for a zipped archive or plain directory whose layout mirrors `/version/first_namespace/second_namespace/...`. The angle-bracket list may contain multiple quoted string paths—`include<"/std/io", "./local/io/helpers", version="1.2.0">`—and the resolver applies the same version selector to each path; mismatched archives raise an error before expansion. Versions live in the leading segment (e.g., `1.2/std/io/*.prime` or `1/std/io/*.prime`). If the version attribute provides one or two numbers (`1` or `1.2`), the newest matching archive is selected; three-part versions (`1.2.0`) require an exact match. Each `.prime` source file is inline-expanded exactly once and registered under its namespace/path (e.g., `/std/io`); duplicate includes are ignored. Folders prefixed with `_` remain private.
- **Transform-driven control flow:** control structures desugar into prefix calls (`if(cond, then{…}, else{…})`). A surface form like `if(cond) { … } else { … }` is accepted and rewritten into the canonical call form. Infix operators (`a + b`) become canonical calls (`plus(a, b)`), ensuring IR/backends see a small, predictable surface.
- **Mutability:** bindings are immutable by default. Opt into mutation by placing `mut` inside the stack-value execution or helper (`[Integer mut] exposure(42)`, `[mut] Create()`). Transforms enforce that only mutable bindings can serve as `assign` or pointer-write targets.

### Example function syntax
```
namespace demo {
  [return<void>]
  hello_values() {
    [string] message("Hello PrimeStruct")
    [i32] iterations(3i32)
    [float mut] exposure(1.25f)
    [float3] tone_curve(0.8f, 0.9f, 1.1f)

    log_line(message)
    assign(exposure, clamp(exposure, 0.0f, 2.0f))
    execute_repeat(iterations) {
      apply_curve(tone_curve, exposure)
    }
  }
}
```
Statements are separated by newlines; semicolons never appear in PrimeStruct source.

### Slash paths & textual operator filters
- Slash-prefixed identifiers (`/pkg/module/thing`) are valid anywhere the uniform envelope expects a name; `namespace foo { ... }` is shorthand for prepending `/foo` to enclosed names, and namespaces may be reopened freely.
- Textual metafunction filters run before the AST exists. Operator filters (e.g., divide) scan the raw character stream: when a `/` is sandwiched between non-whitespace characters they rewrite the surrounding text (`/foo / /bar` → `divide(/foo, /bar)`), but when `/` begins a path segment (start of line or immediately after whitespace/delimiters) the filter leaves it untouched (`/foo/bar/lol()` stays intact). Other operators follow the same no-whitespace rule (`a>b` → `greater_than(a, b)`, `a<b` → `less_than(a, b)`, `a>=b` → `greater_equal(a, b)`, `a<=b` → `less_equal(a, b)`, `a==b` → `equal(a, b)`, `a!=b` → `not_equal(a, b)`).
- Because includes expand first, slash paths survive every filter untouched until the AST builder consumes them, and IR lowering never needs to reason about infix syntax.

### Struct & type categories (draft)
- **Struct tag as transform:** `[struct ...]` in the envelope is purely declarative. It records a layout manifest (field names, types, offsets) and validates the body, but the underlying syntax remains a standard definition. Un-tagged definitions may still be instantiated as structs; they simply skip the extra validation/metadata until another transform (e.g. `[stack]`) demands it.
- **Placement tags (`[stack]`, `[heap]`, `[buffer]`):** placement transforms consume the manifest and enforce where the shape may live. `[stack]` means “legal to instantiate on the stack”; attempting to allocate it on the heap triggers a compile-time error. Future tags like `[heap allocator=arena::frame]` or `[buffer std=std140]` follow the same pattern.
- **POD tag as validation:** `[pod]` asserts trivially-copyable semantics. Violations (hidden lifetimes, handles, async captures) raise diagnostics; without the tag the compiler treats the body permissively.
- **Member syntax:** every field is just a stack-value execution (`[float mut] exposure(1.0f)`, `[handle<PathNode>] target(get_default())`). Attributes (`[mut]`, `[align_bytes(16)]`, `[handle<PathNode>]`) decorate the execution, and transforms record the metadata for layout consumers.
- **Baseline layout rule:** members default to source-order packing. Backend-imposed padding is allowed only when the metadata (`layout.fields[].padding_kind`) records the reason; `[no_padding]` and `[platform_independent_padding]` fail the build if the backend cannot honor them bit-for-bit.
- **Alignment transforms:** `[align_bytes(n)]` (or `[align_kbytes(n)]`) may appear on the struct or field; violations again produce diagnostics instead of silent adjustments.
- **Stack value executions:** every local binding—including struct “fields”—materializes via `[Type qualifiers…] name(args)` so stack frames remain declarative (e.g., `[float mut] exposure(1.0f)`). Default expressions are mandatory for `[stack]` layouts to keep frames fully initialized.
- **Lifecycle helpers (Create/Destroy):** Within a struct-tagged definition, nested definitions named `Create` and `Destroy` gain constructor/destructor semantics. Placement-specific variants add suffixes (`CreateStack`, `DestroyHeap`, etc.). Without these helpers the field initializer list defines the default constructor/destructor semantics. `this` is implicitly available inside helpers (mutable by default) so they can either mutate the instance or merely perform side effects such as logging. Add `mut` to the helper’s transform list when it writes to `this`; omit it for pure helpers. We capitalise system-provided helper names so they stand out, but authors are free to use uppercase identifiers elsewhere—only the documented helper names receive special treatment.
  ```
  namespace demo {
    [struct pod stack]
    color_grade() {
      [float mut] exposure(1.0f)

      [mut]
      Create() {
        assign(this.exposure, clamp(this.exposure, 0.0f, 2.0f))
      }

      Destroy() {
        log_line("color grade destroyed")
      }
    }
  }
  ```
- **IR layout manifest:** `[struct]` extends the IR descriptor with `layout.total_size_bytes`, `layout.alignment_bytes`, and ordered `layout.fields`. Each field record stores `{ name, type, offset_bytes, size_bytes, padding_kind, category }`. Placement transforms consume this manifest verbatim, ensuring C++, VM, and GPU backends share one source of truth.
- **Categories:** `[pod]`, `[handle]`, `[gpu_lane]` tags classify members for borrow/resource rules. Handles remain opaque tokens with subsystem-managed lifetimes; GPU lanes require staging transforms before CPU inspection.
- **Documentation TODO:** finalise how manifest categories map to PathSpace storage classes and ensure placement transforms emit consistent diagnostics when tags conflict (`[stack]` + `[gpu_lane]`, etc.).

### Built-in transforms (draft)
- **Purpose:** built-in transforms are metafunctions that stamp semantic flags on the AST; later passes (borrow checker, backend filters) consume those flags. They do not emit code directly.
- **Evaluation mode:** when the compiler sees `[transform ...]`, it routes through the metafunction's declared signature—pure token rewrites operate on the raw stream, while semantic transforms receive the AST node and in-place metadata writers.
- **`copy`:** force copy-on-entry for a parameter or binding, even when references are the default. Often paired with `mut`.
- **`mut`:** mark the local binding as writable; without it the binding behaves like a `const` reference.
- **`restrict<T>`:** constrain the accepted type to `T` (or satisfy concept-like predicates once defined). Applied alongside `copy`/`mut` when needed.
- **`return<T>`:** optional contract that pins the inferred return type. Recommended for public APIs or when disambiguation is required.
- **`effects(...)`:** declare side-effect capabilities; absence implies purity. Backends reject unsupported capabilities.
- **`align_bytes(n)`, `align_kbytes(n)`:** encode alignment requirements for struct members and buffers. `align_kbytes` applies `n * 1024` bytes before emitting the metadata.
- **Capability helpers:** `capabilities(...)` reuse the transform plumbing to describe opt-in privileges without encoding backend-specific scheduling hints.
- **`struct`, `pod`, `stack`, `heap`, `buffer`:** declarative tags that emit metadata/validation only. They never change syntax; instead they fail compilation when the body violates the advertised contract (e.g., `[stack]` forbids heap placement, `[pod]` forbids handles/async fields).
- **Documentation TODO:** ship a full catalog of built-in transforms once the borrow checker and effect model solidify; this list captures the current baseline only.

### Core library surface (draft)
- **`assign(target, value)`:** canonical mutation primitive; only valid when `target` carried `mut` at declaration time.
- **`plus`, `minus`, `multiply`, `divide`:** arithmetic wrappers used after operator desugaring.
- **`greater_than(left, right)`, `less_than(left, right)`, `greater_equal(left, right)`, `less_equal(left, right)`, `equal(left, right)`, `not_equal(left, right)`:** comparison wrappers used after operator/control-flow desugaring.
- **`clamp(value, min, max)`:** numeric helper used heavily in rendering scripts.
- **`if<Bool>(cond, then{…}, else{…})`:** canonical conditional form after control-flow desugaring.
- **`notify(path, payload)`, `insert`, `take`:** PathSpace integration hooks for signaling and data movement.
- **`return(value)`:** explicit return primitive; may appear as a statement inside control-flow blocks. Implicit `return(void)` fires at end-of-body when omitted.
- **Documentation TODO:** expand this surface into a versioned standard library reference before PrimeStruct moves onto an active milestone.

## Runtime Stack Model (draft)
- **Frames:** each execution pushes a frame recording the instruction pointer, constants, locals, captures, and effect mask. Frames are immutable from the caller’s perspective; `assign` creates new bindings.
- **Deterministic evaluation:** arguments evaluate left-to-right; `return(value)` unwinds automatically. Implicit `return(void)` fires if the body reaches the end.
- **Transform boundaries:** rewrites annotate frame entry/exit so the VM, C++, and GLSL backends share a consistent calling convention.
- **Resource handles:** PathSpace references/handles live inside frames as opaque values; lifetimes follow lexical scope.
- **Tail execution (planned):** future optimisation collapses tail executions to reuse frames (VM optional, GPU required).
- **Effect annotations:** purity by default; explicit `[effects(...)]` opt-ins. Standard library defaults to stdout/stderr effects.

### Execution Metadata (draft)
- **Scheduling scope:** queue/thread selection stays host-driven; v0.1 exposes no stack- or runner-specific annotations, so executions inherit the embedding runtime’s default placement.
- **Capabilities:** effect masks double as capability descriptors (IO, global write, GPU access, etc.). Additional attributes can narrow capabilities (`[capabilities(io_stdout, pathspace_insert)]`).
- **Instrumentation:** executions carry metadata (source file/line plus effect/capability masks) for diagnostics and tracing.
- **Open design items:** finalise the capability taxonomy and determine which instrumentation fields flow into inspector tooling vs. runtime-only logs.

## Type & Class Semantics (draft)
- **Structural classes:** `[return<void>] class<Name>(members{…})` desugars into namespace `Name::` plus constructors/metadata. Instances are produced via constructor executions.
- **Composition over inheritance:** “extends” rewrites replicate members and install delegation logic; no hidden virtual dispatch unless a transform adds it.
- **Generics:** classes accept template parameters (`class<Vector<T>>(…)`) and specialise through the transform pipeline.
- **Interop:** generated code treats classes as structs plus free functions (`Name::method(instance, …)`); VM closures follow the same convention.
- **Field visibility:** stack-value declarations accept `[public]`, `[package]`, or `[private]` transforms (default: private). The compiler records `visibility` metadata per field so tooling and backends enforce access rules consistently. `[package]` exposes the field to any module compiled into the same package; `[public]` emits accessors in the generated namespace surface.
- **Static members:** add `[static]` to hoist storage to namespace scope while reusing the field’s visibility transform. Static fields still participate in the struct manifest so documentation and reflection stay aligned, but only one storage slot exists per struct definition.
- **Example:**
  ```
  namespace demo {
    [struct]
    brush_settings() {
      [public float] size(12.0f)
      [private float] jitter(0.1f)
      [package static handle<Texture>] palette(load_default_palette())

      [public]
      Create() {
        assign(this.size, clamp(this.size, 1.0f, 64.0f))
      }
    }
  }
  ```
- **Open design items:** decide constructor semantics (beyond the `Create`/`Destroy` helpers) and constant member behaviour once the package/effect designs settle.

## Lambdas & Higher-Order Functions (draft)
- **Syntax mirrors definitions:** lambdas omit the identifier (`[capture] <T>(params){ body }`). Captures rewrite into explicit parameters/structs.
- **Capture semantics:** support `[]`, `[=]`, `[&]`, and explicit notations (`[value x, ref y]`). Captures compile to generated structs with `invoke` methods.
- **First-class values:** closures are storable, passable, and returnable. Backends emit them as struct + function pointer (C++), inline function objects (GLSL, where legal), or closure objects (VM).
- **Inlining transforms:** standard transforms may inline pure lambdas; async/task-oriented lambdas stay as closures.
- **PathSpace interop:** captured handles respect frame lifetimes; transforms force reference-count or move semantics as required.

## Literals & Composite Construction (draft)
- **Numeric literals:** decimal, float, hexadecimal with optional width suffixes (`42u32`, `1.0f64`).
  - v0 requires explicit width suffixes for integers (`42i32`). Higher-level filters may add suffixes before parsing; the default compiler pipeline enables implicit `i32` suffixing unless `--no-implicit-i32` is passed.
- **Strings:** quoted with escapes (`"…"`) or raw (`R"( … )"`).
- **Boolean:** keywords `true`, `false` map to backend equivalents.
- **Composite constructors:** structured values are introduced through standard type executions (`ColorGrade(hue_shift = 0.1f, exposure = 0.95f)`) or helper transforms that expand the uniform envelope. Named arguments map to fields, and every field must have either an explicit argument or a placement-provided default before validation.
- **Collections:** `array<Type>{ … }`, `map<Key,Value>{ … }` (or bracket sugar) rewrite to standard builder functions.
- **Conversions:** no implicit coercions. Use explicit executions (`convert<float>(value)`) or custom transforms.
- **Mutability:** values immutable by default; include `mut` in the stack-value execution to opt-in (`[float mut] value(...)`).
- **Open design:** finalise literal suffix catalogue, raw string semantics across backends, and the composite-constructor defaults/validation rules.

## Pointers & References (draft)
- **Explicit types:** `Pointer<T>`, `Reference<T>` mirror C++ semantics; no implicit conversions.
- **Operator transforms:** dereference (`*ptr`), address-of (`&value`), pointer arithmetic desugar to canonical calls (`deref(ptr)`, `address_of(value)`, `pointer_add(ptr, offset)`).
- **Ownership:** references are non-owning, frame-bound views. Pointers can be tagged `raw`, `unique`, `shared` via transform-generated wrappers around PathSpace-aware allocators.
- **Raw memory:** `memory::load/store` primitives expose byte-level access; opt-in to highlight unsafe operations.
- **Layout control:** attributes like `[packed]` guarantee interop-friendly layouts for C++/GLSL.
- **Open design:** pointer qualifier syntax, aliasing rules (restrict/readonly), and GPU backend constraints remain TBD.

## VM Design (draft)
- **Instruction set:** ~50 stack-based ops covering control flow, stack manipulation, memory/pointer access, optional coroutine primitives. No implicit conversions; opcodes mirror the canonical language surface.
- **Frames & stack:** per-call frame with IP, constants, locals, capture refs, effect mask; tail calls reuse frames. Data stack stores tagged `Value` union (primitives, structs, closures, buffers).
- **Bytecode chunks:** compiler emits a chunk (bytecode + const pool) per definition. Executions reference chunks by index; constant pools hold literals, handles, metadata.
- **Native interop:** `CALL_NATIVE` bridges to host/PathSpace helpers via a function table. Effect masks gate what natives can do.
- **Closures:** compile to closure structs (chunk pointer + capture data). Captured handles obey lifetime/ownership rules.
- **Optimisation:** reference counting for heap values; optional chunk caching; future LLVM-backed JIT can feed on the same bytecode when needed.
- **Deployment target:** the VM serves as the sandboxed runtime for user-supplied scripts (e.g., on iOS) where native code generation is unavailable. Effect masks and capabilities enforce per-platform restrictions.

## Examples (sketch)
```
// Pull std::io at version 1.2.0
include<"/std/io", version="1.2.0">

[return<int> default_operators] add<int>(a, b) { return(plus(a, b)); }

[default_operators] execute_add<int>(x, y)

clamp_exposure(img) {
  if<bool>(
    greater_than(img.exposure, 1.0f),
    then{ notify("/warn/exposure", img.exposure); },
    else{ }
  );
}

tweak_color([copy mut restrict<Image>] img) {
  assign(img.exposure, clamp(img.exposure, 0.0f, 1.0f));
  assign(img.gamma, plus(img.gamma, 0.1f));
  apply_grade(img);
}

[return<float> default_operators control_flow desugar_assignment]
float blend(float a, float b) {
  float result = (a + b) * 0.5f;
  if (result > 1.0f) {
    result = 1.0f;
  }
  return result;
}

// Canonical, post-transform form
[return<float>] blend<float>(a, b) {
  assign(result, multiply(plus(a, b), 0.5f));
  if<bool>(
    greater_than(result, 1.0f),
    then{ assign(result, 1.0f); },
    else{ }
  );
  return(result);
}
```

## Integration Points
- **Build system:** extend CMake/tooling to run `PrimeStructc`, track dependency graphs, and support incremental builds.
- **PathSpace Scene Graph:** helper APIs map PrimeStruct modules to scenes/renderers and manage path-based resource bindings.
- **Testing:** unit/looped regression suites verify backend parity (C++, VM, GLSL).
- **Diagnostics:** metrics/logs land under `diagnostics/PrimeStruct/*`. Effect annotations drive error messaging.
- **PathSpace runtime wiring:** generated code uses PathSpace helper APIs (`insert`, `take`, `notify`). Transforms wrap high-level IO primitives so emitted C++/VM code interacts through typed handles; GLSL outputs map onto renderer inputs. Lifetimes/ownership align with PathSpace nodes.

## Dependencies & Related Work
- Stable IR definition & serialization (std::serialization once available).
- Scene graph/rendering plans (`docs/finished/Plan_SceneGraph_Renderer_Finished.md`).
- PathIO/device plans for IO abstractions (`docs/AI_Paths.md`).

## Risks & Research Tasks
- **Memory model** – value/reference semantics, handle lifetimes, POD vs GPU staging rules.
- **Resource bindings** – unify descriptors across CPU/GPU backends.
- **Debugging** – source maps, stack inspection across VM/GPU.
- **Performance** – ensure parity with handwritten code; benchmark harnesses.
- **Adoption** – migration strategy from existing shaders/scripts.
- **Diagnostics** – map compile/runtime errors back to PrimeStruct source across backends.
- **Concurrency** – finalise coroutine/await integrations with PathSpace scheduling.
- **Security** – sandbox policy for transforms/archives.
- **Tooling** – IDE/LSP roadmap, incremental compilation caches, metadata outputs.

## Validation Strategy
- Golden tests comparing outputs from C++, VM, GLSL for shared modules.
- Performance benchmarks recorded under `benchmarks/`.
- Static analysis/lint integrated into CI to catch undefined constructs before codegen.

## Next Steps (Exploratory)
1. Draft detailed syntax/semantics spec and circulate for review. _(Draft v0.1 captured in `docs/PrimeStruct_SyntaxSpec.md` on 2025-11-21; review/feedback tracking TBD.)_
2. Prototype parser + IR builder (Phase 0).
3. Evaluate reuse of existing shader toolchains (glslang, SPIRV-Cross) vs bespoke emitters.
4. Design import/package system (module syntax, search paths, visibility rules, transform distribution).
5. Define library/versioning strategy so include resolution enforces compatibility.
6. Flesh out stack/class specifications (calling convention, class sugar transforms, dispatch strategy) across backends.
7. Lock down composite literal syntax across backends and add conformance tests.
8. Decide machine-code strategy (C++ emission, direct LLVM IR, third-party JIT) and prototype.
9. Define diagnostics/tooling plan (source maps, error reporting pipeline, incremental tooling, future PathSpace-native editor).
10. Document staffing/time requirements before promoting PrimeStruct onto the active PathSpace roadmap.
